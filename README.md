## Just Another Crypto Trader

### How to use
- `npm install`
- configure `config.yaml`
- `npm start`
- Have fun getting JACT!

__Use JACT at your own risk__

### Todo
1. Finish new architecture, (see bot.alt.js)
2. Track open/received orders against filled orders by orderId. Bot is confusing manual orders from GDAX gui with it's own
3. Immediately create a stop loss order when placing a buy at a percentage of the purchase price
4. Write reports to CSV
5. Implement cost averaging option
6. Add more strategies
7. Ability to combine strategies/indicators
